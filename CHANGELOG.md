 now with the **actual major fixes and updates**

| Updated item      | Detailed description | Nerdy description |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------ | 
| Alerts      | Instead of using JS alerts, made popups, so they look better now!       | Used library SweetAlert2 via CDN and configured/replaced all `alert()` with `Swal.fire(config goes here)` |
| Navbar   | Removed the Home option, users can just click the `Snorlax's Cave` option to go to the home page. Fixed option cutoff, fixed games and other content going above the navbar. Since navbar is sticky (persistently stays with the screen), removed the space between the navbar and top of page.         |  im too lazy, just use the description, there was a lot of changes with the navbar. see for your self! |
| Settings| Combined multiple features, added "Disable About:Blank for 15 minutes" feature and some UI changes | Added br tags above and below all headers in each setting container to make sure that there is space, combined the tab utilities and the background utilities together, rounded all buttons and inputs to 999px, removed duplicate reset button,
